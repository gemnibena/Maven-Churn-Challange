# Maven-Churn-Challenge
For this challenge, I'll be assuming the role of a BI Consultant for Maven Communications, a California-based Telecommunications company.  I've been hired to help the company improve retention by identifying high value customers and churn risks, and have been asked to present my findings to the CMO in the form of a single page report or dashboard.
